## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m Niranjan!

Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo

⚙️ I’m interested in systems programming, performance-oriented software, and applied machine learning. I enjoy working close to the hardware, understanding how software behaves under real-world constraints, and building systems that are correct, efficient, and predictable.

📚 I care deeply about learning fundamentals and applying them through hands-on projects.I try to reason from first principles and improve through iteration.

💡 I’m always looking to learn more — whether that’s new systems concepts, better debugging techniques, or how large software projects are designed and maintained in practice.
