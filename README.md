## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m Niranjan!

Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo

⚙️ I’m interested in systems programming, performance-oriented software, and applied machine learning. I enjoy working close to the hardware, understanding how software behaves under real-world constraints, and building systems that are correct, efficient, and predictable.

📚 I care deeply about learning fundamentals and applying them through hands-on projects. Whether it’s understanding memory layout in C++, timing behavior in emulators, or validation in machine learning, I try to reason from first principles and improve through iteration.

🔬 Previously worked as a Research Assistant at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I gained exposure to applied machine learning workflows in a digital health context under faculty supervision. Alongside this, I’ve built independent projects that apply similar techniques end-to-end.

🏊 Outside of software, I’ve worked in safety-critical, real-time environments as a Swim Instructor & Lifeguard, which strengthened my ability to stay calm under pressure, follow strict protocols, and make reliable decisions in dynamic situations.

💡 I’m always looking to learn more — whether that’s new systems concepts, better debugging techniques, or how large software projects are designed and maintained in practice.
